# Homework 1 (Ling 334)
## Due April 14, 2015

Note: Remember to list all others you worked with at the top of your assignment. Also remember that you must do your own write-up and your own programming.

### Problem 0: setting up homework directories
First, you'll create a `ling334` directory in your SSCC home directory and some subdirectories. Then you'll set the permission so that I have access to them. This is where you'll save your homework code that I will grade. To create these directions and set permissions, run the following commands (in order):

    mkdir ~/ling334
    mkdir ~/ling334/hw1
    mkdir ~/ling334/hw2
    mkdir ~/ling334/hw3
    mkdir ~/ling334/hw4
    mkdir ~/ling334/project
    chmod g=x $HOME
    chmod -R g=rx ~/ling334
